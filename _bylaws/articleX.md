The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect CALAâ€™s interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Corporation or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. Representatives of CALA including but not limited to members of Executive Board, elected officials, committee and task force chairpersons or co-chairpersons, chapter presidents and officers shall avoid any conflict between their respective personal, professional, or business interests and the interests of CALA, in any and all actions taken by them on behalf of CALA in their respective capacities.

This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to non-profit and charitable corporations.

Rules and procedures are defined in the Conflict of Interest Policy.
