It also archives CALA’s official documents, CALA and its Chapters’ conference materials, and Chinese cultural heritage collections. Currently, over 600 items have been added to CALASYS’ open and private collections. In the last 365 days, it has over 364740 hits.

In celebration of the CALA’s 50th Anniversary, the CALASYS Collection Grant was created which aimed to preserve the history of CALA, Chinese American librarians, and the Chinese American community, encourage CALA members’ participation in CALASYS and enrich its collections. This training session will be attended by the grant recipients and with anyone who’s interested in contributing to CALASYS.
By opening CALASYS to all, each contributing individual, committee, and chapter will be able to deposit works and documents. You can also be the manager of your own collection after going through additional trainings with the Committee. It is hoped that CALASYS will continue to grow at a faster pace and in a more inclusive direction.
Let's celebrate CALA's 50th anniversary together! Please contact the CALASYS Committee at calasys@cala-web.org if you need more information or have any questions. Thank you for your participation, enthusiasm, and support!

Sincerely,

The CALASYS Committee
