The 2008-2009 Chinese American Librarians Association Best Book Award Committee has chosen Steer Toward Rock by Fae Myenne Ng as the Best Adult Fiction Book, The Writer as Migrant by Ha Jin as the Best Non-Fiction Adult Book, Dragon Road by Laurence Yep as the Best Young Adult Book, and Mei Ling in China City by Icy Smith as the Best Children's Book. The prizes promote Chinese American culture and heritage and are awarded based on literary and artistic merit. The goal of the CALA Annual Best Book Award is to heighten awareness of the best books of Chinese topics or literature written by an author of Chinese descent. The Award is to honor English or Chinese language books originally published in North America in 2008. The award will be presented at the CALA 2009 Annual Award Banquet on Sunday, July 12 2009 in conjunction with the ALA Conference in Chicago.  The CALA 2009 Award Banquet is from 6:30pm-10pm, July 12, 2009 at the Phoenix Restaurant located at 2131 S Archer Ave # 2, Chicago, IL 60616.
