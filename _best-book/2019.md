Front Desk

Author Kelly Yang tells a story about the family of Chinese immigrants who has been struggling with every day’s life, from the view of a ten-year-old girl who takes over the front desk of a motel that her parents manage. With her parents, this little girl needs to deal with a cruel and exploitive owner while handling all kinds of problem pertaining to the routine management as well as racism, dangers, and bully encountered. Even with enormous hardship, the author uses a positive tone throughout to describe a successful story that this immigrant family has experienced.

 

The Shadow in the Moon

The author brings together several important Chinese cultural elements into this little children’s book: fairy tales, moon stories, shooting down the suns, moon cakes etc.. The author did a good job by rendering them into a readable story.

 
Sincerely,

Li Sun
